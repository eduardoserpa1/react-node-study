#  Studies about an full-stack web project
This code use React.js in front end and Node.js API with express in back-end


### **Details about the implementation**
- REST API with Node.js and Express 
- Nodemon
- React.js with styled-components
- React-route-dom
- Axios

#

### How to run
- **Front-end**

to install all the packages dependencies, on front-end root directory, run:
```bash
npm install
```
after that, to start your aplication (in development mode), run:
```bash
npm start
```
#

- **Back-end**

like front-end, you have to install all the packages dependencies too, for this, run:
```bash
npm install
```
and after that, you run the node aplication with nodemon, which provides hot reloading of server changes, so in the Back-end root path, run:
```bash
nodemon App.js
```
with the two aplications running correctly, you should have your API running on _url: **localhost:/8000**_ and your front-end aplication running on _url: **localhost:/3000**_.
